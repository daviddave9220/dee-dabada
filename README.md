Ur own webpage profile

Hi guys, I want a dynamic webpage with ur own creative url that shows about who u r in detail( like a resume), ur updated location using google maps, where people can follow u like f for facebook,t for tweeter ,g for google and i for insta.This page should be in a way that it is compatible and viewed across all devices for example like tab, laptop or even ur handphone.If ur using laptop or a tab, when ur making the webpage smaller, it will change the homepage into a simpler profile by changing the font and everything according to the size of the webpage until it reaches a certain limit,than it will change into another homepage with customisable menu icon and a customisable background with your pic, name,time,date and weather forecast.If you don't make the webpage smaller than ur webpage will be showing everything in an order starting from ur first homepage which shows a menu button that can lead u straight to the place where u clicked on, ur pic,name,time,date and weather with customizable background than followed by ur details when u scrool down adn at the end of the page will be ur gps tracking, message board with the person's name,email address, description and message which people can send u a message that u can view in ur email directly.And ur social network sites that have only the symbols that has no color. It will change colour to its original symbol color if your mouse goes to the symbol but u need not have to click on the symbol just to see the changes of the color. If it is viewed in mobile where when u type ur url it displays ur homepage as same as when u make the webpage smaller by using a laptop. This webpage should be very very fast to load and this webpage is for u and me as a selling point for the community and for the organisation.Thank you
